          <p>Tech-World is an ambitious multimedia effort founded in 2018 to examine how technology will change life in the future for a massive mainstream audience.</p>
          <p>Our original editorial insight was that technology had migrated from the far fringes of the culture to the absolute center as mobile technology created a new generation of digital consumers. Now, we live in a dazzling world of screens that has ushered in revolutions in media, transportation, and science. The future is arriving faster than ever.</p>
          <p>We love tech! We're unashamedly geeky about it. So we'll tell you what we think in a fair, unbiased way. That's what we're about.</p>
          <p>We're able to promise this because Tech-World is the largest Serbian-based consumer technology news and (and now rapidly growing in the US and Australia), our editorial independence backed by the weight of technology publisher Future plus objective test data from the Tech-World Labs.</p>
